In todays era **Knowledge is Power** and we believe that empowering the underdeveloped is a key to develop Smart India. Our solution for the  idea is to create an Android Application which can give the real time data about all the important information and details about the college/school.

Our app consist information about the trending college and all the information related the admission and its facilities, a link to each college/school will also be their so the if needed we can direct parents directly to their home page.
